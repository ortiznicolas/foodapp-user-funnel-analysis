🧭 Project: “Conversion Funnel Optimization and A/B Testing for an E-commerce App”
📌 Brief Description

This project analyzes user behavior within a food retail mobile application to identify friction points in the conversion funnel and assess the impact of a typographic redesign through an A/A/B test.

🎯 Objective and Context

The goal was to understand how users progress from login to final purchase, identify at which stages the most significant drop-offs occur, and evaluate whether the new font design affects conversion rates.
Through the A/A/B experiment, we validated the consistency between control groups and assessed the effectiveness of the redesign in the experimental group.

🧠 Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Inferential Statistics (hypothesis testing, significance level analysis)

Conversion Funnel Analysis

Data Visualization

📊 Key Results and Insights

The greatest user drop-off occurred between the product view and add-to-cart stages.

No statistically significant differences were found between control groups A1 and A2, confirming the experiment’s reliability.

The new font design did not negatively impact the conversion rate, supporting a safe rollout across the platform.

Strengthened skills in experimental design, statistical validation, and data storytelling.
